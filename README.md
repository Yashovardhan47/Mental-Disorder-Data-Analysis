# Mental-Disorder-Data-Analysis
Data Analysis of Mental Disorder people based on Age, Symptoms and Incidents with Python and Machine Learning Models.
ABSTRACT: 
    This study undertakes a comprehensive analysis of mental disorder data to identify patterns, prevalence, and relationships among different menta health disorders and their associated symptoms across various age groups. The data analysis covers key aspects, including age distribution, disorder incidence rates, symptom prevalence, and the overall clustering of disorders, aiming to provide insights into mental health trends and risk factors.
    To begin, the analysis explores the age profile distribution to identify themost impacted age groups and visualize the general demographic spread. The study further categorizes and averages the incidence rates for eachdisorder, offering a comparative look at the most and least prevalent mentalhealth conditions. Additionally, symptoms are aggregated and visualized tohighlight the most common mental health symptoms associated with thes disorders, providing a comprehensive view of symptom prevalence.
     A time-based trend analysis groups the data by disorder, revealing anysignificant changes in disorder rates over time. Clustering is also performedto detect any naturally occurring groups among disorders and symptoms, aiding in the discovery of disorder co-occurrence patterns. Furthermore,prevalence rates for each disorder are calculated by normalizing incidence rates against population size, presenting a clearer understanding of how    common each disorder is within the population.
     The study also implements various machine learning models—including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree, Random Forest,K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Logistic Regression, CatBoost, and XGBoost—to classify mental disorders based on input features. Each model is evaluated on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, allowing for aperformance comparison that reveals which models are most effective in diagnosing mental health conditions based on available data.

INTRO: 
 Mental health disorders are a growing concern worldwide, impacting individuals across diverse age groups, backgrounds, and societies. The need for a deeper understanding of mental health trends, prevalence, and contributing factors has led to increased efforts in collecting and analyzing data related to various mental
 health conditions. This study focuses on performing a detailed analysis of mental disorder data, aiming to extract insights that can support healthcare providers,
 policymakers, and mental health researchers in making informed decisions. Through this analysis, we aim to reveal patterns and trends within the data, showcasing the distribution of disorders, prevalent symptoms, demographic profiles, and the relationships between different disorders and symptoms.
     
COMPREHENSIVE MENTAL DISORDER ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION:
1. Age Profile Distribution: 
 This section analyzes the age distribution of individuals diagnosed with variousmental disorders, providing insights into the age groups most affected by specific
 conditions. A histogram is used to visualize this distribution, helping to identifypotential age-related trends. Understanding these patterns is essential for targeting interventions effectively. By examining age demographics, we gain a clearer perspective on how mental health issues are distributed across different life stages.

2. Average Incidence by Disorder: 
 In this section, we calculate and display the average incidence of each disorder within thedataset. By visualizing the average incidence, we can identify which disorders are most prevalent. This analysis aids in prioritizing mental health resources by highlighting disordersthat occur more frequently. Additionally, this section provides a comparative overview of disorder types based on incidence rates.

3.Symptom Incidence Summary: 
 This analysis focuses on summarizing the occurrence of various symptoms associated withmental disorders. A bar chart is used to present the frequency of each symptom, revealing common and rare symptoms across the dataset. Understanding symptom prevalence helps in recognizing patterns and potential comorbid symptoms. This summary provides insights intothe general symptomatology associated with mental health disorders.

4.Disorder Incidence Bar Chart: 
 This section uses a bar chart to visualize the total number of cases for each diagnosed disorder. By summing the incidences, we get an overview of the distribution of different mentaldisorders. This graphical representation helps in quickly identifying the most and least diagnosed conditions within the dataset, supporting decision-making for mental health interventions.

5.Clustering of Disorders:
 In this section, disorders are grouped using clustering techniques to identify patterns and trends.Clustering allows us to explore associations between disorders that commonly occur together,revealing potential links and co-occurrence trends. This analysis is crucial for understandingcomplex relationships within mental health data, providing insights for targeted therapeutic approaches.

6.Prevalence Rate Analysis:
 Here, we calculate the prevalence rate of each disorder by dividing the incidence by the overall dataset size. Visualizing prevalence helps in understanding the proportion of individuals affected by each disorder. This analysis is essential for public health planning, as it highlights the relative impact of each condition in the population.

7.Symptom Association Visualization: 
 This section examines the associations between symptoms and various disorders, displaying the results graphically. By identifying symptoms that commonly occur together within specificdisorders, we can gain insights into underlying symptom clusters. This information is valuablefor clinicians in diagnosing and understanding complex mental health conditions.

8.Machine Learning Classification and Evaluation: 
 This section details the application of machine learning models to classify mental disorders based on the dataset attributes. Models such as Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression, CatBoost, and XGBoost are employed. Each model’s performance is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, helping to determine the most effective model for mental disorder classification.

 CONCLUSION: 
     This comprehensive analysis of mental disorder data has illuminated several critical insights into the prevalence, patterns, and predictive modeling of mental
 health conditions. Through rigorous exploratory data analysis and the application of advanced machine learning techniques.
     High Prevalence of Mental Disorders: The findings reveal that Anxiety Disorders and Depression are the most prevalent mental health issues within the studied  
 population, particularly among younger individuals aged 18 to 35. This demographic trend highlights the urgent need for mental health interventions
 tailored to this vulnerable group, as they are facing unique challenges that can exacerbate their mental health conditions.
     Call to Action: The insights from this analysis underscore the importance of continued research and investment in mental health resources. There is a pressing 
 need for educational programs that promote mental health awareness, destigmatize treatment, and encourage early intervention. Additionally, collaborative efforts 
 between healthcare providers, researchers, and policymakers are essential to develop comprehensive mental health strategies that address both prevention and treatment.
