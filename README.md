# Mental-Disorder-Data-Analysis
Data Analysis of Mental Disorder people based on Age, Symptoms and Incidents with Python and Machine Learning Models.
ABSTRACT: 
    This study undertakes a comprehensive analysis of mental disorder data to identify patterns, prevalence, and relationships among different menta health disorders and their associated symptoms across various age groups. The data analysis covers key aspects, including age distribution, disorder incidence rates, symptom prevalence, and the overall clustering of disorders, aiming to provide insights into mental health trends and risk factors.
    To begin, the analysis explores the age profile distribution to identify themost impacted age groups and visualize the general demographic spread. The study further categorizes and averages the incidence rates for eachdisorder, offering a comparative look at the most and least prevalent mentalhealth conditions. Additionally, symptoms are aggregated and visualized tohighlight the most common mental health symptoms associated with thes disorders, providing a comprehensive view of symptom prevalence.
     A time-based trend analysis groups the data by disorder, revealing anysignificant changes in disorder rates over time. Clustering is also performedto detect any naturally occurring groups among disorders and symptoms, aiding in the discovery of disorder co-occurrence patterns. Furthermore,prevalence rates for each disorder are calculated by normalizing incidence rates against population size, presenting a clearer understanding of how    common each disorder is within the population.
     The study also implements various machine learning models—including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree, Random Forest,K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Logistic Regression, CatBoost, and XGBoost—to classify mental disorders based on input features. Each model is evaluated on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, allowing for aperformance comparison that reveals which models are most effective in diagnosing mental health conditions based on available data.
     
COMPREHENSIVE MENTAL DISORDER ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION:
1. Age Profile Distribution
 This section analyzes the age distribution of individuals diagnosed with variousmental disorders, providing insights into the age groups most affected by specific
 conditions. A histogram is used to visualize this distribution, helping to identifypotential age-related trends. Understanding these patterns is essential for targeting interventions effectively. By examining age demographics, we gain a clearer perspective on how mental health issues are distributed across different life stages.
